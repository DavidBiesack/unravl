*.json files in this directory are UnRAVL scripts which are run from unit tests.
They should only access REST services that are expected to be up and running.

See also the folder "fail"  which includes tests but which are expected to fail if run;
this is for testing failure situations, assertions, etc.

The folder "interactive" is for demos, etc. Most require editing the script before running
them.
